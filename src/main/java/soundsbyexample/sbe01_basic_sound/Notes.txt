SBE01_BASIC_SOUND

The purpose of this example is to show how to register a sound and play it.
It will show you
1) the location of the sounds.json file and standard location for a mods sound
   files.
2) how to register sounds and reference them.
3) some examples of how to play sounds. For this example an item with
   subtypes is used.
4) using subtitles

The critical aspects, as with items and blocks, are understanding how to use a
ResourceLocation and where in the mods assets tree the sounds.json and the mods
audio files are located.

The pieces you need to understand are located in:
StartupCommon
ItemBasicSound
src/main/resources/assets/soundsbyexample/sounds.json
src/main/resources/assets/soundsbyexample/lang/en_US.lang

The items will appear in the Miscellaneous tab in the creative inventory.

You can't include comments in the sounds.json file. So I've copied if here and
added comments.

				# Typically these sounds will have lengths from under a second up to 2-3
				# seconds. For longer sounds like background music and records that may last
				# several minutes, set stream to true and make sure it is associated with

Common errors:
"Missing sound", "Missing texture", etc:
These are caused when you have specified a filename or path which is not correct, typically:
1) you've misspelled it
2) the upper/lower case doesn't match
3) you've forgotten the resource domain, eg "mysoundfile" instead of "soundsbyexample:mysoundfile"
4) the folder structure of your assets folders is incorrect
