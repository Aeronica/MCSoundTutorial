SBE02_MOD_RECORD

The purpose of this example is to show how add a music disc (record).
It will show you
1) how to register sounds and reference them.
2) how to extend the vanilla ItemRecord to make new record.

The critical aspects, as with items and blocks, are understanding how to use a
ResourceLocation and where in the mods assets tree the sounds.json and the mods
audio files are located.

The pieces you need to understand are located in:
StartupClient
StartupCommon
ItemModRecord
src/main/resources/assets/soundsbyexample/sounds.json
src/main/resources/assets/soundsbyexample/lang/en_US.lang
src/main/resources/assets/soundsbyexample/sounds/records

The items will appear in the Miscellaneous tab in the creative inventory.

You can't include comments in the sounds.json file. So I've copied the
relevant section here and added comments.
{
	# assets/soundsbyexample/sounds.json
	# for more information see http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Sounds.json
	# The information on the wiki may be out of date so it's useful to
	# review the Forge vanilla sounds.json too.
	
	# This is the name of the sound resource. It must match the resource name
	# used when registering it. Note that we don't include the modid here. 
	# See StartupCommon.preInitCommon()
	#
	# Vanilla prefixes the sound registry name for records with "record."
	# As of 1.10+ the sound "category" key value pair is no longer used.
		
	"record.sbe02_sound_event_mod_record_registry_name":
	{
		"sounds":
		[
			{
			"name": "soundsbyexample:records/Pachelbel's_Canon",
			"stream": true
			}
		]
	}
}

Common errors:
"Missing sound", "Missing texture", etc:
These are caused when you have specified a filename or path which is not correct, typically:
1) you've misspelled it
2) the upper/lower case doesn't match
3) you've forgotten the resource domain, eg "mysoundfile" instead of "soundsbyexample:mysoundfile"
4) the folder structure of your assets folders is incorrect
